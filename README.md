# Hi, I'm Fique
 I’m a passionate technologist with a knack for building smart solutions that bridge ideas and impact. Some technologies i enjoy working with include HTML, CSS, Javascript, python, django, mysql, c++, c#, java and basic knowledge on Azure. I love turning complex challenges into elegant code and scalable systems. I'm driven by curiosity and always exploring the next innovation at the intersection of technology and creativity.

When I'm not coding, I’m probably reading up on emerging tech, contributing to open-source, or tinkering with side projects. Let’s build something awesome.
